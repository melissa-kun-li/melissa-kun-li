### Hi there 👋

🎋 I'm Melissa! I'm a Computer Science student in my senior year interested in backend, distributed systems, and open source.  
🤩 I'm currently participating in Hacktoberfest and learning Rust :)  
👩🏻‍💻 I've previously interned as a software engineer at LinkedIn and Red Hat. I also was an open source Outreachy intern with Ceph!  
✨ Fun fact: I also have a degree in Health Science, and my enjoyment of open source is why I decided to pursue CS.   
🎧 Recently got into audiobooks (currently reading Circe by Madeline Miller).
